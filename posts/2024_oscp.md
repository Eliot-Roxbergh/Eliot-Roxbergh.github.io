# OSCP certification

In early 2024, I completed my OSCP certification after working as a penetration tester for 1.5 years.
The OSCP is a hands-on penetration testing course that covers a broad range of topics, including Linux, Windows (Active Directory), and web hacking.
While it doesn't delve too deeply into any single area, I found the course to be enjoyable and relevant to my work.
However, there are more affordable but lesser-known alternatives, such as Hack The Box CPTS, as the OSCP is indeed priced at $2,599 for a one-year subscription.
