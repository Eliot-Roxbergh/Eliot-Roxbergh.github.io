# C Programming

After working with C for the last two years (2020-2022), I did some small side projects to practice and summarize what I have learned.

My latest exercise [Portknock](https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/task_portknocker) gives an example on how to develop in C (cmake, code analysis, GCC flags, unit tests, ..),
and [Static Analysis](https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/static_analysis) compares different static analysis tools for C.

For reading on security for the C language see [Secure C](https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/examples/blob/master/c_programming/book_secure_c.md) that contains my study notes, intended for use as a reference.
