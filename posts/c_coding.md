# C Programming

After working with C for the last two years (2020-2022), I did some small side projects to practice and summarize what I have learned.

My latest exercise [Portknock](https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/task_portknocker) gives an example on how to develop in C (cmake, code analysis, GCC flags, unit tests, ..),
and [Static Analysis](https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/static_analysis) compares different static analysis tools for C.

### Primary Examples

**Portknock Exercise** (code exercise with summary of testing and flow: cmake etc.) \

**Static Analysis** (short case study & presentation on SAST for C) \
