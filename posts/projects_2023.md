# Small projects 2023

In lack of new blog posts, I would like to refer to some small projects I've recently completed.
These projects have a more practical nature.

**2023-05:** I tried the open-source security device **Tillitis TKey**. A more trustable alternative to 2FA tokens, for instance? Find my post here: <https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/tillitis_hello>.

**2022-10:** I spent one month using the open-source **Linux phone**, Pinephone, as a daily driver. Linux phones are still immature, but the essentials are coming into place. \
