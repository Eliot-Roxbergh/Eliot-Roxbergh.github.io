# Small projects 2023

In lack of new blog posts, I would like to refer to some small projects I've recently done.
These projects have a more practical nature.

**2023-05:** I tried the open-source security device **Tillitis TKey**. A more trustable alternative to 2FA tokens, for instance? Find my post here: <https://www.assured.se/posts/getting-started-tillitis-tkey-security-token>
(or for a shorter version: <https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/tillitis_hello>).

**2023-04:** After working with a client, I updated my earlier post on [GPL compliance](https://r0x.se/#gpl-compliance) to include additional information about LGPL.

**2022-10:** I spent one month using the open-source **Linux phone**, Pinephone, as a daily driver. Linux phones are still immature, but the essentials are coming into place. \
