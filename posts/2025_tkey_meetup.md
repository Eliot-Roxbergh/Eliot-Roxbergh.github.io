# Inbyggd frihets TKey-hackathon

Saturday the 25th October,
Inbyggd-Frihet will organize a TKey hackathon at Assured's office in Gothenburg.

The Tillitis TKey is an open-source software, and open-source hardware, USB security token made in Sweden.
It is capable of providing an extra layer of security for use cases such as cryptographic signing, (SSH, PAM, etc.) login, and random number generation.
For more information about the TKey see below.

The goal of the hackathon will be to collaborate on improving the TKey software and to work on finding, and implementing, more use cases for the TKey.
This is not a competitive hackathon, instead our aim is to get started with, and to improve, the TKey together with others, have fun and share ideas.

If you already know something that you want to implement, you can include it with your registration.
At the start of the event, these ideas will be presented, and people may freely choose an idea that they find interesting, and collaborate on for the day.

**Prerequisites:** \
Bring a laptop if you wish to partake in the hackathon.

**Schedule:** \
12:00 Doors open \
13:00 TALK: Introduction \
13:10 TALK: Getting started with TKey and the emulator\
13:30 TALK: Introduction round and presentation of hackathon ideas.\
14:00 HACK: Join a group and start hacking\
17:00-18:00: Food\
20:00: Present your achievements\
21:00: End of event


## Further reading


_The TKey is an open source security token created by the Mullvad spin-off Tillitis AB. Both its software and its hardware (schematics, PCB, and FPGA design) are open source._
_The TKey was released in April of 2023 with a price tag of 880 SEK (incl. tax) and available from the Tillitis store._

_The TKey is a small device drawing less than 100mA._
_It provides a few basic functions (either in firmware or by the provided apps and libs) such as Ed25519 signing, key derivation, BLAKE2 hashing, and a good random number generator (TRNG)._
_It also has a sensor for user confirmation._
_With these features, the TKey can be used for various functionalities, such as authentication (signing, SSH login, passkey, etc.), serving as a root of trust (sign/encrypt), or as a source of entropy (TRNG/CSPRNG)._\
