# C Material

Working with C the last two years, I did some small side projects to practice and summarize what I have learned.

**Tl;dr** check the latest exercise Portknock to see an example of how to develop in C (cmake, code analysis, GCC flags, unit tests, ..),
and Static Analysis to get some inspiration for more code analysis to run.

## Primary Examples

**Portknock Exercise** (code exercise with summary of testing and flow: cmake etc.) \
<https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/task_portknocker> 

**Static Analysis** (short case study & presentation) \
<https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/static_analysis>


## Notes and Shorter Guides

**Secure Coding in C and C++** (book summary and notes on C programming) \
TODO skim through and make public

**Notes** (on how to use GDB, vim (cscope), ... but see Portknock exercise for example setup) \
<https://github.com/Eliot-Roxbergh/examples/tree/master/c_programming/development_tips>


## More Code Examples

# TODO
Sync files such as GCC Flags, add C book summary, and this text with links \
 \
Clean "Minor C code examples"
